# redux-persist-state

redux persist state is a package that helps you persist your Redux store data across page reloads.

# <p style="background:yellow;color:#000">!Important Note<p>
Redux persist state package persists Redux state data across page reloads, but the data is not visible in any web storage. After reloading the page, Redux data is restored automatically.

## Installation

To install the package, you can use npm:

```sh
npm install redux-persist-state
```

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use redux-persist-state in your Redux setup.

### Step 1:

Configure the Redux Store
First, create your Redux store and configure it to use persistReducer from redux-persist-state.

```sh
// store.js
import { configureStore, combineReducers } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import { persistReducer, persistInitialize } from 'redux-persist-state';
import counterSlice from './counterSlice';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  counter: counterSlice,
});

const persistedReducer = persistReducer(rootReducer);

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: persistedReducer,
});

persistInitialize(store);

```

# API
`persistReducer`
```sh
persistReducer(rootReducer: any): any
```
Enhances the root reducer to handle rehydration from persist store.

`persistInitialize`
```
persistInitialize(store: any): void
```
persistInitialize the mechanism for persisting Redux state data. This function ensures that your Redux store's state persists across page reloads without being visible in any web storage options, including localStorage, sessionStorage, or any other web storage. The internal algorithm handles the persistence and restoration of the state automatically.
